The core part of the Quant SDK is the ability to automate trading strategies. 
The potential applications of strategies are vast: 
while simple portfolio rebalancing mechanisms can be implemented, 
higher-frequency quantitative strategies may be deployed as well.
The Quant SDK can be installed in the terminal as follows:
```
pip install quant-sdk
```
To use the Quant SDK, you need to authenticate yourself using your personalized Blocksize CORE™ API-Token. 
A Blocksize CORE™ API-Token can be generated in the Blocksize MATRIX™ API Token Settings. 
The Quant SDK can be used to trade on all of our connected exchanges which can be found on our Matrix dashboard.
